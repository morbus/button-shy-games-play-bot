# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file,
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased] - Core

- Add in all the Sapphire and Discord plugins, cos why not.
- Will the theme scrollbar the nav when 100 games exist?
- Don't run a game if private game data has not been filled in?
- Reduce an arg collection of members (ex. @a @b @a) to unique members only?
  Would have to be game-specific though, cos maybe they're playing a three
  player cooperative game two-handed.

## [Unreleased] - I Guess This Is It

- Game data documentation.
- --with-grid support.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-07
