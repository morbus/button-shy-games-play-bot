# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file,
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

- Add in all the Sapphire and Discord plugins, cos why not.
- Will the theme scrollbar the nav when 100 games exist?
- Don't run a game if private game data has not been filled in?
- Reduce an arg collection of members (ex. @a @b @a) to unique members only?
  Would have to be game-specific though, cos maybe they're playing a three
  player cooperative game two-handed.
- Add footer for the full documentation URL?
- I Guess This Is It: Require two players.
- I Guess This Is It: Game data documentation.
- I Guess This Is It: --with-grid support.
- I Guess This Is It: Add aliases to docs.
